# Climate Manifesto & Actions

A manifesto based on a simple set of three policies, with a set of actions currently being taken against each.

The idea isn't to compete with others, but to learn about impactful ideas I could also adopt.

**To combat climage change I will:**

1. 📖 LEARN and SHARE.
2. 🧑‍💻 Take every opportunity at my WORKPLACE to address the issue.
3. 🏡 Act at HOME and in my PERSONAL life to combat climate change.

### As a family

1. 💸 We save 10% of income for a climate action fund (We "tax" all non-essential spending (non-food/accomodation etc) 10% to create a ring-fenced fund for use realising the goals of this manifesto)
2. 🛬 We no longer fly (starting 2016)
3. 🚗 We drive an electic vehicle (EV)
4. 🌬️ We only consume electricity when the grid's [carbon intensitiy](https://carbonintensity.org.uk) is at it's lowest for the next 4 day period, otherwise we don't consume:

    1. Charge the car
    2. Wash our clothes

5. 🔥 We are working to de-decarbonise our home:

    1. We removed our gas hob, infavour of induction [(🎥 watch why)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX2aZUav-54)
